You need to change the extension of the file, if the file is not with the extension .vbs if not follow this simples steps:
First you need to change (Chrome.txt) to .vbs, go to the Memo Pad, click in File, click in Save as..., Change the name to Chrome.vbs and Save, next go to the location of the file and go to properties and hide the file but after put a Shortcut in the Desktop, Then Hide the original file. And that's just open the shortcut and the code is going to start.
I'm not responsible of uses if this code.
