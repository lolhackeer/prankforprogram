You need to change the extension of the file, if the file is not with the extension .vbs if not follow this simples steps:
First you need to change (Chrome.txt) to .vbs, go to the Memo Pad, click in File, click in Save as..., Change the name to Chrome.vbs and Save, next go to the location of the file and go to properties and hide the file but after put a Shortcut in the Desktop, Then Hide the original file. And also you need to change the icon of the shortcut you need to go to the real Chrome shortcut go to properties go to change icon go and copy the root of the icon and paste in the fake Chrome shortcut and select the Chrome's icon, save your settigs
